# Go Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kindafearless/goserver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kindafearless/goserver)

To make changes, create a fork to copy all over the files. Click the fork button within Github, it then asks which organization to fork it into. This creates a new repo in your organization, and you have access to all the files and commit messages.
The server is already dockerized. There is a docker file within the repo.
